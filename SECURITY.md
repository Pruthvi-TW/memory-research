# Security Guidelines

## 🔒 Sensitive Data Protection

This project handles sensitive financial and personal data. Follow these security guidelines:

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- Store production secrets in secure secret management systems
- Rotate API keys regularly

### API Keys & Credentials
The following sensitive data is protected by `.gitignore`:
- Anthropic API keys
- OpenAI API keys  
- Mem0 API keys
- Neo4j database credentials
- GitHub tokens
- JWT secrets
- Session secrets

### Database Security
- Neo4j database files are excluded from version control
- Vector database storage (Chroma) is not committed
- Memory layer data is protected
- All uploaded files and processed content are excluded

### File Uploads & Processing
- Uploaded files are stored in protected directories
- Temporary processing files are automatically cleaned up
- Dynamic content is not committed to version control
- Customer data and financial records are never stored in git

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Development
1. Use `.env.example` to set up your local environment
2. Never hardcode secrets in source code
3. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
4. Enable debug mode only in development

### Production
1. Use secure secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
2. Enable HTTPS and secure cookies
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Monitor for security vulnerabilities
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Data Handling
1. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
2. Implement proper access controls
3. Log security events for monitoring
4. Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
5. Comply with financial regulations (PCI DSS, etc.)

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the security team immediately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Wait for confirmation before disclosing publicly

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] All secrets are stored securely (not in code)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled and enforced
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] File upload validation is implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are active
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and scanned
- [ ] Access controls are properly configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

Monitor these security metrics:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- File upload anomalies
- Database access patterns
- Error rates and exceptions
- Resource usage spikes

## 📚 Compliance

This system may need to comply with:
- **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **SOX** (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- **Local financial regulations**

Ensure proper data handling, retention, and deletion policies are implemented.
